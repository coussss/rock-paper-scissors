Rock, paper, scissors game

4/1/23 
I've been assigned to create a simple rock, 
paper, scissors game within the console using
the javascript I have learned so far.

Plan:

-create function to randomly return rock, paper 
or scissors
-create variable that prompts the user to use 
rock, paper or scissors (case insensitive)
-create function that compares both random choice
with player choice and return appropriate message
-new function with for loop for 5 rounds a call 
previous game function
-use winCount to keep track of score (if 
winCount > 2 player wins)

Plan 6/2/23:

-remove logic that plays 5 rounds
-create three buttons with event listeners that
calls 'playRound' function with changes player
selection to appropriate attack
-create div to display results, and use DOM 
methods for displaying
-display running score and announce winner 
after 5 rounds
